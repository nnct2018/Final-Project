									<p>As a rising senior and the only child of two immigrant parents, I had to educate myself on the college application process in the US. I found that all the information I needed was spread out across an endless number of sources. So with SmartCookies, the goal was to make the application process understandable and less intimidating by providing all the information a student would need in one place.</p>

									<p>My friends and I created this website to help out other high schoolers. I’m the eldest in my family and I will be the first one going to a university or college. I like that this website gives all the information that you need and allows you to know what awaits after high school. :)</p>

									<p>I am a rising junior who is soon to be on the path to a stressful senior year. Having refugee parents and attending a school with little resources makes college prep difficult. A website like SmartCookies assists students who are in a similar position to me. It compiles all the necessary information and tips into one simple and easy website.</p>

									<p>Being the oldest in my family, things were always trial and error with me. Since my family moved to the U.S when I was in 5th grade, we were clueless about the school system. I hope this website helps those families out there who who are new to the country and need help with transition from high school to college.</p>
