						<h2>Application Process</h2>
						<p>Applying to college is comprised of many steps and requires planning ahead. Here you will find FAQs to help you understand and get ahead of the process.</p>
					</header><a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="books.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<font size="4">
					<p1><b>What does the typical application look like?</b></p1>
	        <br><p2>Every college has different requirements, but most ask for the same basic elements: either an ACT or SAT score report, an essay, a high school transcript, letters of reccomendation (from a teacher and/or counselor), and an application fee.</p2>
	        <br><br><p20><b>Here is a brief explanation of each of the elements (some are explained in other tabs):</b></p20><br>
	        <br><p21><b>High School Transcript:</b></p21><br>
	        <p22>A record of a student's classes and grades to show how the student challenged themself and performed in their classes. This includes the student's GPA (grade point average), which measures all the grades a student has earned during their academic career.</p22>
	        <br><br><p23><b>Letters of Recommendation:</b></23><br>
	        <p24>A letter written by an adult such as a teacher or advisor who can vouch for a student's work, personality, and performance. </p24>
	        <br><br><p25><b>Application Fee:</b></p25><br>
	        <p26>Most (but not all) colleges require a fee in order to apply to their school. This is paid directly to the school through the application platform (like Common App or Coalition App).</p26>
					<hr><a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="desk.jpg" alt="" /></a><p3><b>What are the Common App and Coalition App?</b></p3>
	        <br><p4>Both are online application platforms that allow students to apply to mutiple schools at once. Students have to create an account, fill out the general application, choose what schools they want to apply to, and submit any addition requirements schools may have (like a personal statement), all of which can be done from the website. </p4>
	        <br><br><p5><b>What is the difference between the Common App and Coalition App?</b></p5>
	        <br><p6>As of now, 774 colleges accept the Common Application and 113 colleges accept the Coalition App. So be sure to check which application the school you want to apply to accepts. </p6>
	        <br><br><p7><b>What if a college accepts both the Common App and Coalition App?</b></p7>
	        <br><p8>If a college accepts both applications, they usually give the student the option to choose which one they would like to use. Sometimes, schools like Georgia Tech will not even consider one of the applications if you submit both. </p8>
	        <br><br><p9><b>Do all colleges accept the Common App or Coalition App?</b></p9>
	        <br><p10>No, some schools like Georgetown and MIT have their individual application process in place, which is accessible through their website. Other schools have their own system with each other, like the universities in California, where a student fills out one application to apply to their nine campuses. And there is another application platform similar to the Common App and Coalition App, called the Universal College Application.</p10>
	        <br><br><p11><b>Once the Common App or Coalition App is submitted, is the college application process complete?</b></p11>
	        <br><p12>Not necessarily. Students need to remember that platforms like the Common App or Coalition App do not take your SAT or ACT score report or your high scool transcript. Your SAT score or ACT score needs to sent to the schools you want to apply to through the organizations that administer the tests (ex. the College Board for the SAT). And your high school transcript would need to be sent to the schools you want to apply to through your high school. Keep in mind that sending these items to colleges requires a fee. However, there are waivers available for those in financial need.</p12>

					<p27><b>How to ask for a recommendation letter:</b></p27>
	        <br><p28>1. Choose someone who knows you well and will give you a strong recommendation (not a generic one), such as a teacher, counselor, employer, advisor, or mentor.</p28>
					<br><p33>			-Check each college's requirements. Some want letters only from specific subject teachers or from counselors.</p33>
	        <br><p29>2. Always ask AHEAD OF TIME. Do not ask the night before or the day a recommendation is due. Approach whoever you need to write a letter in advance to ask them if they have the time and are willing to write a letter for you in the future.</p29>
	        <br><p31>4. Prepare what you will say ahead of time (why you asked that specific teacher/counselor, what the letter is for, etc...)</p31>
	        <br><p32>5. Give the teacher information about yourself (like your activites, passions, and what you want to pursue).</p32>
					<hr><a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="teble.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p13><b>Do colleges want my AP test scores?</b></p13>
					<br><p14>Reporting AP scores is not a requirement and far from one of the most factor of the application process. However, students who are applying to selective schools or want college credit should report their scores. (But remember that every college has different standards when it comes to accepting AP credits, which is something students can check on a college's website)<p14>
